*** READ BEFORE USING CHEMICAL DATABASE PROGRAM ***

This program features the ability to store and retreive the properties of as many chemicals that are added to the database.
The program comes with 4 chemicals pre-loaded: Water, Benzene, Ethanol, and Acrolein. The database features are accessed via the main menu by entering the options shown into the command line. The program also has a stocking feature that allows the user to store how much chemicals they have in stock and change the amount. The menu options are as follows:

1 - Show all chemicals
	This option displays the list of all chemicals currently in the database.

2 - Add or remove a chemical
	This option allows the user to either add a new chemical to the database, or to remove one of the existing chemicals.

3 - Retrieve a property
	This allows the user to select and display one or all of the properties stored in the database for a given chemical.

4 - Calculate a vapor pressure
	This option allows the user to enter the temperature at which they want to calculate the vapor pressure of a given database chemical in bar.

5 - Show Stockroom
	This option allows the user to see which chemicals and how much are in stock.

6 - Add or Remove Stock
	This option allows for a user to add or remove stock of a chemical.


Notes:
To add a chemical to stock, it must first be in the database.
It is assumed the user has basic chemistry knowledge and can undersatand the units and values provided.
